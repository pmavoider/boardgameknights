            "description": "  Scythe  gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player's individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are \"Encounter\" cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.   Scythe  uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.  Every part of  Scythe  has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times. ",

With two new characters (the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist) face the game in ways you never thought possible as brand-new, virulent challenges await you! \r\n In   Pandemic  , several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand. \r\n The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are  Epidemic!  cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the \"normal\" spread of the infections. \r\n Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five—but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win! \r\n The 2013 edition of  Pandemic  includes two new characters—the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist—not available in earlier editions of the game. \r\n Artists: \r\n Joshua Cappel (graphics and illustration) \r\n Régis Moulun (cover painting) \r\n Chris Quilliams (2013 edition)    ",

If you found your settlements in the right places and skillfully trade your resources, then the odds will be in your favor.

Catan is born - a beautiful island with mountains, pastures, hills, fields, and forests, surrounded by the sea. \r\n Each of us places two small houses on spaces where three terrain hexes meet. They are our starting settlements. \r\n And so it begins. I roll two dice. An “11”! Each terrain hex is marked with a die roll number. Each player who owns a settlement adjacent to a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives a resource produced by this hex. Hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool. \r\n We use these resources to expand across Catan: we build roads and new settlements, or we upgrade our existing settlements to cities. For example, a road costs 1 brick and 1 lumber. If we do not have the necessary resources, we can acquire them by trading with our opponents. \r\n Each settlement is worth 1 victory point and each city is worth 2 victory points.

            "description": "  Backgammon  is a classic abstract strategy game dating back thousands of years. Each player has a set of 15 checkers (or stones) that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of their checkers to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's checkers, forcing the captured checkers to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 checkers off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the \"doubling cube\", which allows players to up the stakes of the game. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll and measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get. \r\n  Backgammon  may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920s, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters. \r\n The names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard which means \"Battle on Wood\". In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (\"game of twelve marks\"), later, Tabula (\"table\"), and by the sixth century, Alea (\"dice\"). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from \"Bac gamen\" meaning \"Back Game\", referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board. \r\n It was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called \"The Aristocratic Game.\" The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world's first travel edition?). \r\n The rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle. These remained popular until the American innovations of the 1930s. ",

Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board. Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon. The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand. Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file. To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations.

On a square checkered board, where individual color squares alternate between the two colors, the two sides are divided with each player controlling half. Discs of each players' color are placed in the very back two rows of their side, with single spaces in between. \r\n The goal of the game is to move forward and hop over your opponent's pieces to eliminate them before they do the same. Pieces can only move on space towards their opponent's side and only to an adjacent, diagonal location. The only exception to this is when you attack, or \"jump\", your opponent. This move has you moving two spaces toward your opponent's side in a diagonal direction where one of your opponent's discs is located in between. If you are successful, the jumped piece is removed from the board. You may not make a move if there is a piece blocking your end location (your's right next to you for regular moves, or two in a row in the case of an attack jump. You are only ever allowed to make legal moves that have a location to go to. Blocked pieces cannot move. \r\n In addition to moving the one direction toward your opponent's side, trying to attack (jump) your opponent's pieces. , there is an additional bonus move. If you are able to move one of your discs all the way to the far edge of your opponent's side, your piece is turned into a \"king\" with an additional checker disc added on top of it to signify this. The bonus of a king is they are able to move both forward AND BACKWARD as long as they adhere to all other movement rules. \r\n Once all of a player's checker discs (player pieces) are removed from the board because they have been jumped, that player loses and the other player is victorious.

Debt, disease, heartache, and packs of rabid flesh-eating mice -- just when it seems like things can't get any worse, they do. But some say that one's reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope -- if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond.   In the  Gloom  card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You'll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents' characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins.   Printed on transparent plastic cards,  Gloom  features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them.
